In this competition, you’re challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. 
You’ll have access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified. 

Each sample in the train and test set has the following information:

The text of a tweet
A keyword from that tweet (although this may be blank!)
The location the tweet was sent from (may also be blank)
What am I predicting?
You are predicting whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not. If so, predict a 1. If not, predict a 0.
